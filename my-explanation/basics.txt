what is graphql ?
-> its a strongly typed query language and runtime for your data.
it sits infront of your api
its open source and created by facebook
it gives power to the client to describe exactly what data you want
its just like a typeSCript for your data
excellent developer tooling and experiences
it can sit infront of any api
ecosystem is fantastic


2.graphql vs rest
1.graphql only has one url . it doesnot require (resources + verb) combo . the request details are in post body (sometimes get)
2.in rest shape and size of your data resources are determined by the server. in graphql its determined by the query (request) like its dynamic
3.you have to make multiple api calls to retrieve relational data with graphql you can start with the entry resources and traverse all the connections in one request
4.in rest a single request will execute on the controller on the server, in graphql a request might execute many resolvers on the server
